    <h3>Chocolatey fudgy Brownies</h3>
    <p>They are rich, fudgy in the middle, and made completely from scratch. These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp espresso powder</li>
        <li>2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup plus 2 Tbsp boiling water</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp butter </li>
        <li>½ cup plus 2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your baking dish by lining with aluminum foil or parchment paper and greasing with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine cocoa powder, espresso powder, chopped unsweetened chocolate, and boiling water. Stir to combine and get everything melted.</li>
        <li>While still warm, add butter and stir until melted. Add vegetable oil and stir again.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture has cooled, add the eggs and egg yolks and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla extract and whisk, then add granulated sugar and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Next, add flour. Mix it thoroughly and then add the chopped bittersweet chocolate. Stir to combine one last time.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes, until a tester comes out clean-ish.</li>
        <li>Let brownies cool for one hour in the pan. </li>
        <li>Remove them from pan using parchment or foil. Serve and enjoy! </li>
